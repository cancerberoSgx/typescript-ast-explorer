# typescript-ast-explorer

WIP

 * Early proof of the concept [screen casts](demos.md)
 * explore a local TypeScript project with an Command Line interactive tool. 
 * See it file structure and the AST nodes inside each file. 
 * Navigate through the AST and source code like. 

## TODO 

 * query elements across the project using CSS-like language (tsquery)
 * filter nodes by kind or name  or query
 * apply refactors interactively
 * tree expand all - collapse all

### Issues

 * in file view - remove details parent and leave the children only.
 * should we add the code view in the file view?
 * file view: expand first folder automatically.
 * when switching from files view to code view it should open in last viewed node and viceversa - auto-expanding the tree
